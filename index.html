                    <p class="desc">
                        This is the city in Arkansas that i was born in. Right at JRMC(which is the major hospital in Pine Bluff), and lived in the city for about 15 yrs. I've seen buildings built and a lot of my favorite places disappear, due to Pine Bluff's iffy notority.

                        The city, in which I graduated High School from, and grew to make a lot of friends and memories. Even had gotten my first job in this city and it continued until a little after I started college. This city by far was way better than Pine Bluff in my opinion but hey you like what you like.

                        I lived in Japan for about 6 months, but it was awesome. The reason I was able to live in Japan was because I was selected to do a study abroad program. So I went to college at Komazawa University(駒澤大学), which I had to major in Journalism(didn't work out too good), and took a lot of Russian classes. Fun fact my favorite japanese food is Gyuudon(牛丼).

                        After returning back from Japan, and being bored of Russellville. I moved to Fayetteville with my girlfriend so she can be closer to some of her family. But what i didn't know I had some friends here in the same city. We have gone to Dickson st(which is a popular night life place to visit close to the college), and I got to experience my first bar, at the age of 24.
